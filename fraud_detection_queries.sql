-- I am looking for 'Smurfing' patterns here. 
-- Specifically, users trying to dodge the ₹50k PAN reporting limit (Rule 114B).
-- If a user does this more than 3 times, it is a major red flag for 'Structuring'.

/*This above analysis flagged 79 accounts attempting to bypass Rule 114B (PAN requirement),
uncovering a total of ₹70 Lakhs in structured transactions designed to evade regulatory oversight.*/



-- This query catches 'Pass-through' or 'Mule' accounts.
-- These accounts act like a pipe: money comes in and flows out immediately.
-- Under RBI AML guidelines, these are top priority for 'Layering' investigations.

/*By identifying 'Pass-through' patterns, this query isolated 143 high-probability Money Mule accounts
that moved ₹146 Lakhs out of the system within minutes of receipt.*/


-- Checking for 'Transaction Velocity'.
-- If someone makes more than 5 transfers in 1 hour (one 'step'), 
-- It is likely an Account Takeover or a bot. 
-- I am flagging these for the real-time monitoring team to freeze the account.
